# 🎮 AI Dungeon Game (Python + BFS + Genetic Algorithm)

An intelligent dungeon game built using **Python and Pygame**, featuring **AI-powered enemy movement**, **procedural map generation**, and **interactive UI with difficulty selection**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project combines **Game Development + Artificial Intelligence concepts** to create a dynamic dungeon environment where:

* 🧠 The **enemy uses BFS (Breadth-First Search)** to chase the player
* 🧬 Maps are generated using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**
* 🎯 Players can choose difficulty levels before starting
* 🔁 Player has a special **wrap-around ability** (edge teleport)
* 🟡 Enemy follows realistic constraints (no teleport, respects walls)

---

## 🎯 Features

### 🤖 AI Enemy System

* Uses **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** for shortest path finding
* Dynamically tracks player position
* Difficulty affects enemy speed

---

### 🧬 Procedural Map Generation

* Maps generated using **Genetic Algorithm**
* Fitness based on:

  * Solvability
  * Path length (complexity)
* Avoids impossible or trivial maps

---

### 🎮 Gameplay Mechanics

* Player starts at **S (Start)**
* Goal is to reach **E (End)**
* Avoid enemy (🟡)
* Walls (#) block movement

---

### 🔁 Unique Player Ability

* Player can **wrap around edges**

  * Left → Right
  * Top → Bottom
* Adds strategic gameplay advantage

---

### 🎯 Difficulty System

| Level  | Enemy Speed | Experience         |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Easy   | Slow        | Beginner-friendly  |
| Medium | Balanced    | Moderate challenge |
| Hard   | Fast        | Intense gameplay   |

---

### 🎨 UI System

* Interactive buttons:

  * Start Game
  * Difficulty Selection
  * Restart
* Hover effects
* Clean layout with step counter
* Win / Lose screens

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

### 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

* Used for enemy pathfinding
* Guarantees shortest path
* Implemented using queue (FIFO)

---

### 2. Genetic Algorithm (GA)

* Population-based map generation
* Includes:

  * Selection
  * Crossover
  * Mutation
* Fitness = path length (via BFS solver)
